# Fire-Coders BOT app

- We made a Project called EMISHA BOT, which takes input from user and show the corressponding output.
- We can Access this by using *GOOGLE ASSISTANT*, or *DIALOGFLOW SIMULATOR*.
- First of all ask GOOGLE ASSISTANT to Test EMISHA, then Ask for help, and it suggest you all the commands which it can perform.
- hen, Speak or Type your commands, what you want to access, and it shows the corressponding output.
- or example, we can ask EMISHA BOT:  "what is Emisha?" and then It will reply the output.
